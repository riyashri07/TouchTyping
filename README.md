# Touch Typing App

The Touch Typing App is a web-based application designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. It provides a platform for users to practice their typing skills by displaying random words that need to be typed accurately and quickly. The app also tracks and displays various metrics, including words per minute (WPM), accuracy percentage, and a history of the user's performance for the last five attempts.

## Features

- Random Word Generation: The app generates random words of varying lengths, offering a diverse typing experience for users.
- Typing Accuracy Tracking: The app tracks the accuracy of the user's typing by comparing the typed input with the displayed words.
- Words Per Minute (WPM) Calculation: The app calculates the user's typing speed in words per minute, providing real-time feedback on their performance.
- Timer: A built-in timer starts when the user begins typing and stops when the entire phrase has been accurately typed, allowing for time tracking.
- Performance History: The app keeps a record of the user's performance for the last five attempts, including WPM, accuracy, and time elapsed.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app features a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to focus on their typing practice.
